For single parents to whom the widow/widower exemption does not apply, the widow/widower exemption is deemed to apply (limited to foster parents and persons responsible for support).
*1 If the recipient is the mother, neither the special widow(er)’s exemption nor the widow(er)’s exemption will apply.
*2. If the recipient is the father, the widow(er)’s exemption will not apply.
<Example> In the case of an annual income of 2 million yen, 400,000 yen of child support received by the recipient, 100,000 yen of child support received by the eligible child, 3 children, 3 dependents under the tax law, and no person responsible for support, etc.
Full payment is less than 1.63 million yen, partial payment is less than 3.06 million yen, and full payment is suspended for amounts over 3.06 million yen.
80% of the child support will be added to income, so 2,000,000 yen + (400,000 yen + 100,000 yen) x 0.8 = 2,400,000 yen.
Subtracting the deduction from this amount yields 2.4 million yen - 80,000 yen (fixed deduction) = 2.32 million yen, which falls under the category of “partial payment”.
The monthly allowance for the first person is 43,150 yen - (2.32 million yen (income) - 1.63 million yen) x 0.0230559 = 27,240 yen
For the second person, it is 10,180 yen - (2,320,000 yen (income) - 1,630,000 yen) × 0.0035524 = 7,730 yen
For the third person, it is 6,100 yen - (2,320,000 yen (income) - 1,630,000 yen) × 0.0021259 = 4,630 yen
The total will be 39,600 yen.
