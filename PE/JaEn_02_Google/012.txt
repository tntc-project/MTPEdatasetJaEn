Submission of School Lunch Application Form
Thank you for your continued understanding and cooperation with our school.
Regarding school lunches, the City of Nagoya bears the cost of facility maintenance and personnel expenses for cooks, etc., and parents bear the cost of purchasing school lunch materials as part of the school lunch expenses. It is a system to manage school lunches by sharing the burden between the City of Nagoya and parents.
As a general rule, the school lunch fee is 4,400 yen per month (excluding August. Fees may be revised in the future.), and we ask that you please pay by the due date.
In order to clarify the relationship between the school and parents in the provision of school lunches, please submit the application form below.
