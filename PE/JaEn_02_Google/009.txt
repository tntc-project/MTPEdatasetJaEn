Greetings
I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to you and everyone involved for your support in holding the "Sister and Friendship Cities Children's Drawing Exhibition" sponsored by the Nagoya City Board of Education.
Last year, we held the 42nd Sister and Friendship Cities Children's Drawing Exhibition at the Nagoya City Museum from November 18th to 23rd, 2021, and it was a great success.
Therefore, although it is very late, I would like to send you some picture postcards featuring works selected from the exhibition by the children of Nagoya City and Nagoya's sister and friendship cities as a commemorative gift. I hope you will find them useful.
In addition, this year as well, as part of the Sister and Friendship Cities project, the 43rd Sister and Friendship Cities Children's Drawing Exhibition will be held from November 17 to 21, 2021, and we are planning an exhibition of the works submitted by children from sister and friendship cities.
I am very sorry to ask you in the midst of various issues such as measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19, but if possible, I would like you to send some works by children in your city by September 1, 2021. Thank you for your consideration.
I believe that when many people view children's works sent by sister and friendship cities, it will help to promote mutual understanding and deepening friendships between the cities.
I look forward to your continued cooperation in the future.
Sincerely,
Nagoya City Board of Education
