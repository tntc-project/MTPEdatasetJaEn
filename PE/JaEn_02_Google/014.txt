Widow/widower deductions are applied to single parents who are not eligible for widow/widower deductions (limited to caregivers and person responsible for support).
*1 If the recipient is the mother, the special widow deduction and widow deduction are not applied.
*2 If the recipient is the father, the widower deduction is not applied.
<Example> Annual income of 2 million yen, child support received by the recipient of 400,000 yen, child support received by the target child of 100,000 yen, 3 children, 3 dependent relatives under the tax law, and no persons responsible for support, etc.
Full payment is less than 1.63 million yen, partial payment is less than 3.06 million yen, and full payment is suspended for 3.06 million yen or more.
80% of child support is added to income, so 2 million yen + (400,000 yen + 100,000 yen) x 0.8 = 2.4 million yen.
If you subtract the deduction from this, it will be 2.4 million yen - 80,000 yen (fixed amount deduction) = 2.32 million yen, which corresponds to "partial payment".
The monthly allowance for the first child is 43,150 yen - (2.32 million yen (income) – 1.63 million yen) x 0.0230559 = 27,240 yen
The second child is 10,180 yen - (2.32 million yen (income) – 1.63 million yen) x 0.0035524 = 7,730 yen
The third child is 6,100 yen - (2.32 million yen (income) – 1.63 million yen) x 0.0021259 = 4,630 yen
The total is 39,600 yen.
