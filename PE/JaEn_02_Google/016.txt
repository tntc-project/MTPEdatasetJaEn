Information on Admission
Your child will be of the age to enter elementary school in Japan in April next year.
We will confirm the school you wish to enroll your child in, so please submit the enclosed school enrollment status survey form by September 1 in principle.
Children who will enter elementary school in April next year are those who were born between April 2, 2015 and April 1, 2016.
Please fill in the enclosed school enrollment status survey form and submit it to the Citizens' Section counter at your ward office or the Citizens’ Office counter at your branch office.
If you wish to enroll your child in a Nagoya municipal elementary school, you will need to go through the enrollment procedures, so be sure to come to the Citizens' Section counter at your ward office or the Citizens’ Office counter at your branch office.
If you are unable to confirm which school your child will attend, we will send you a confirmation letter at a later date, so we ask for your cooperation.
If you have any other questions, please contact us at the contact details given below.
