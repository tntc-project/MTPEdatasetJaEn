About Submission of School Lunch Application Form
Thank you for your understanding and cooperation with our school education.
With regard to school lunch, the Nagoya-city government bears the cost of facility maintenance and personnel costs for cooks, while guardians bear the cost of purchasing school lunch materials for their children as school lunch costs. Both the Nagoya-city government and guardians bear the cost of running school lunch.
As a general rule, the monthly school lunch cost is 4,400 yen (excluding August, which may be revised in the future). Please pay by the due date.
In order to clarify the relationship between the school and guardians in providing school lunch, we ask that you submit the following application form.
