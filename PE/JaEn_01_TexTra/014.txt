A single parent who is not eligible for Widow / Widower's Deduction shall be deemed to be eligible for Widow / Widower's Deduction (limited to a rearer or a person responsible for the dependent).
*1 If the recipient is the mother, Widow's Deduction and Special Widow's Deduction are not applicable.
* 2 If the recipient is the father, the Widower's Deduction will not be applied.
<Example> Annual income of 2 million yen, child support of 400000 yen received by the recipient, child support of 100,000 yen received by the eligible child, three children, three dependents under the tax law, and no person responsible for the dependent.
The full payment will be for less than 1.63 million yen, the partial payment will be for less than 3.06 million yen, and the full payment will be stopped if it's more than 3.06 million yen.
Since 80% of child support is added to the income, 2 million yen + (400000 yen + 100,000 yen) x 0.8 = 2.4 million yen.
Subtracting the amount of deduction from this, 2.4 million yen - 80000 yen (fixed amount deduction) = 2.32 million yen, which corresponds to "partial payment".
The monthly allowance for the first child is 43,150 yen - (2.32 million yen (income) - 1.63 million yen) x 0.0230559 = 27,240 yen.
10,180 yen - (2.32 million yen (income) - 1.63 million yen) × 0.0035524 = 7,730 yen for the second child
6,100 yen - (2.32 million yen (income) - 1.63 million yen) × 0.0021259 = 4,630 yen for the third child
It is 39,600 yen in total.
