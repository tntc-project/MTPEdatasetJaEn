Information on Novel Coronavirus Vaccine Vaccination Certificates
This document will be issued to those who have received the novel coronavirus vaccine and, due to overseas travel or other circumstances, need a document proving that they have received the vaccination other than the vaccination certificate.
This vaccination certificate is limited to overseas travel for the time being.
In Japan, even if you don't have this certificate, you can confirm the fact of vaccination with the vaccination certificate.
How to apply
We only accept applications by mail.
There is no fee for the issuance of the certificate except for the postage for application and delivery.
* Please contact the call center if you are going to travel in a few days and the issuance of the certificate by mail is not fast enough.
