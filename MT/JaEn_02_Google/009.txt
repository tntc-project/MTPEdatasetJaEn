Greetings
I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to you and everyone involved for your support in holding the "Sister and Friendship Cities Children's Drawing Exhibition" sponsored by the Nagoya City Board of Education.
Last year, we held the 42nd Sister and Friendship Cities Children's Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition at the Nagoya City Museum from November 18th to 23rd, 2021, and it was a great success.
Therefore, although it is very late, I would like to post to your city the works selected from among the works exhibited in this exhibition by the children of Nagoya City and the works sent by Nagoya's sister and friendship cities. We will send you a picture postcard as a souvenir, so we would appreciate it if you could use it.
In addition, this year as well, as part of the sister and friendship city project, the 43rd Sister and Friendship Cities Children's Drawing Exhibition will be held from November 17 to 21, 2021. We are planning an exhibition of the submitted works.
I am very sorry to ask you in the midst of various issues such as measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus infection, but if possible, I would like you to send the works of children in your city by September 1, 2021. Thank you for your consideration.
We believe that the wide public appreciation of children's works sent by sister and friendship cities serves the purpose of promoting mutual understanding and deepening friendship between the two cities. I think.
We look forward to your continued cooperation in the future.
Very truly yours
Nagoya City Board of Education
