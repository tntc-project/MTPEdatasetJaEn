Submission of school lunch application form
Thank you for your continued understanding and cooperation in the education of our school.
Regarding school lunches, the City of Nagoya bears the cost of facility maintenance, personnel expenses for cooks, etc., and parents/guardians bear the cost of purchasing school lunch materials as part of the school lunch expenses. It is a system to manage school lunches by the burden of both parents and guardians.
As a general rule, the school lunch fee is 4,400 yen per month (excluding August. There is a possibility of revision in the future.), so please pay by the due date.
In order to clarify the relationship between the school and parents in the provision of school lunches, please submit the application form below.
