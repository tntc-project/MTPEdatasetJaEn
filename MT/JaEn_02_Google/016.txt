Information on admission
Your child will be of age to enter elementary school next April in Japan.
We will confirm the school you wish to enroll in, so please submit the enclosed school enrollment status survey form by September 1st.
Children entering elementary school next April must be born between April 2, 2015 and April 1, 2016.
Please fill in the enclosed survey form for school enrollment status and submit it to the Citizens' Section counter of the ward office or branch office's Citizens Section.
If you wish to enroll your child in a Nagoya municipal elementary school, you will need to go through the enrollment procedures, so be sure to come to the Citizens' Section of the Ward Office/Branch Citizens' Section.
If you are unable to confirm which school you will be attending this time, we will send you a confirmation letter at a later date, so please cooperate with us.
If you have any other questions, please contact us below.
