Full payment is less than 1.63 million yen, partial payment is less than 3.06 million yen, and full payment is suspended for 3.06 million yen or more.
80% of child support will be added to income, so 2 million yen + (400,000 yen + 100,000 yen) x 0.8 = 2.4 million yen.
If you subtract the deduction amount from this, it will be 2.4 million yen - 80,000 yen (fixed amount deduction) = 2.32 million yen, which corresponds to "partial payment".
The monthly allowance for the first person is 43,150 yen - (2,320,000 yen (income) - 1,630,000 yen) x 0.0230559 = 27,240 yen
The second person is 10,180 yen - (2,320,000 yen (income) - 1,630,000 yen) x 0.0035524 = 7,730 yen
The third person is 6,100 yen - (2,320,000 yen (income) - 1,630,000 yen) x 0.0021259 = 4,630 yen
The total is 39,600 yen.
