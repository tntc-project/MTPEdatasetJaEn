Admission Information

As a rule, please submit the enclosed School Enrollment Status Questionnaire by September 1, as we will confirm the school you wish to enroll in.
Children entering elementary school next April are those born between April 2, 2015 and April 1, 2016.
Please fill out the enclosed School Enrollment Status Questionnaire and submit it to the Citizens' Section counter at the Citizens' Division of the Ward Office or Branch Office.
If you wish to enroll in a Nagoya City elementary school, please be sure to visit the Citizens Section of your ward office or branch office to complete the enrollment procedures.
