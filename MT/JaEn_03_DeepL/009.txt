Dear ○○○○ Mayor

Dear Sir
We would like to express our sincere appreciation to you and all those involved for your support of the "Sister and Friendship Cities Children's Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition" organized by the Nagoya City Board of Education.
Last year, the "42nd Sister and Friendship Cities Children's Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition" was held at the Nagoya City Museum from November 18 to 23, 2021, and was a great success.
We would be very grateful if you could send a postcard to your city as a commemorative gift, featuring the works of Nagoya children who participated in the exhibition and selected works from our sister and friendship cities.
Also this year, as part of the sister and friendship city program, the "43rd Sister and Friendship Cities Children's Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition" will be held from November 17 to 21, 2021, and we are planning to exhibit works submitted from each of the sister and friendship cities of our city.
We are very sorry to ask you to do this in the midst of various issues such as measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus, but if possible, we would appreciate it if you could arrange for the works of children in your city to be sent to us by September 1, 2021.
We believe that it is appropriate for the purpose of promoting mutual understanding and deepening friendship between our two cities that children's works sent from our sister and friendship cities are widely appreciated by the citizens of both cities.
We appreciate your continued cooperation.
Yours truly
Nagoya City Board of Education
Superintendent of Education ○ ○ ○ ○ ○
