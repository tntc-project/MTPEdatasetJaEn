Are you okay with that sound?
What is the noise of daily life?
Noise in daily life is the sound generated by household life, such as "the sound of the TV," "the sound of a door opening and closing," "the sound of a piano," and so on.
Noise from daily life is a sound that occurs as a result of daily living, so it is not possible to avoid emitting it altogether.
Sound is perceived differently by different people.
Sounds that are "unavoidable" or "pleasant to me" in daily life may be perceived as "noisy" or "unpleasant" by those around me. They may be perceived as "noisy" or "unpleasant" by those around them.
It is important to pay attention to the sounds you make on a daily basis, and to take care not to make unnecessary noises and to devise ways to reduce the volume of sound.
If you have a good relationship with your neighbors, such as by greeting them on a daily basis, noise from daily life may be relatively unproblematic.
