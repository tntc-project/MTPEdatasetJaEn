Hello
I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to you and all those concerned for your support in holding the "Sister Friendship City Children and Students Calligraphic Exhibition" sponsored by the Nagoya City Board of Education.
Last year, we held the 42nd Sister City Children's Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition at Nagoya City Museum from November 18 to 23, 2021, and the exhibition was a great success.
So I am very late, but I would like to send you a postcard as a memento that shows the works that children in Nagoya city submitted to this exhibition and the works selected from the works sent from sister cities and friendship cities in this city. I hope you find it useful.
This year, as part of the Sister and Friendship City Project, the 43rd Sister Friendship City Children and Students Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition will be held from November 17 to 21, 2021. We are planning to exhibit works received from each city that is a sister and friendship city of this city.
Amidst various issues such as measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus infections, We are very sorry for the request, but if possible, we would like to ask you to send the works of children in your city by September 1, 2021, and we would like you to arrange it.
We believe that it is appropriate for the purpose of promoting mutual understanding and deepening friendship between the two cities that the works of children sent from sister cities and friendship cities are widely appreciated by citizens.
We look forward to your continued cooperation.
Sincerely yours
Nagoya City Board of Education
